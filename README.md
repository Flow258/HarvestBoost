Of course. Here is a comprehensive README file for your HarvestBoost plugin, created by combining all the details from your plugin.yml, config.yml, and the previous Java code.

üå± HarvestBoost Plugin
A cooperative farming plugin for Minecraft 1.21 that encourages players to farm together by boosting crop growth when multiple players are active in the same area.

üéØ Core Features
Cooperative Growth Boost: Crops, saplings, and other plants grow significantly faster when 2 or more players are farming in close proximity.

Highly Configurable: Customize nearly every aspect, including boost levels, detection radius, supported plants, and performance settings.

Informative Visuals: Players receive feedback through configurable particle effects, action bar messages, and sound effects.

Multiple Plant Types: The boost applies to a wide variety of plants, including standard crops, saplings, bamboo, sugar cane, and kelp.

XP Bonuses: Reward cooperative farming with extra experience points when harvesting fully grown crops.

Performance Tuned: Built to be lightweight with settings to control processing load (max-crops-per-tick) and efficient location caching.

World Blacklist: Disable the plugin's effects in specific worlds like the Nether or The End.

Customizable Messages: Change all player-facing messages to match your server's theme.

üìä Default Boost Scaling
The growth speed bonus scales with the number of players farming together. This is fully customizable in the config.yml.

Players Nearby	Growth Speed Multiplier	Boost Percentage
1 (solo)	1.0x	0
2 players	1.25x	+25
3 players	1.5x	+50
4+ players	1.75x	+75 (max)

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (config.yml)
The plugin is controlled through a detailed configuration file, allowing you to fine-tune its behavior.
